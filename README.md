# Admissions Tracker

## Features

The Admissions Tracker was built for four types of users: Potential Candidates, Existing Candidates, Admissions Officers, and Instructors. All users are able to view courses and the course specifics. 
Potential candidates are able to apply for a particular course and then view a candidate profile that displays their submitted application information.
Admissions Officers can log into the site and view potential candidates and access a questionnaire for a phone screen. A timer is available on the questionnaire for use by the Admissions Officer.
Instructors are also able to log into the site and view potential candidates. Instructors can access a questionnaire for an in-person interview.
